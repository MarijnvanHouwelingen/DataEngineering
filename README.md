# Rules when working in my Repo :)

## Branching
Whenever you start working. Start a *Branch*. This is done by the command: git checkout -b feature/branchname.
Make sure to name the branch after the work you are doing, e.g feature/mlops. After you have finished work
on your task, use git add . -> git commit -m "message" and git push to push your changes to Github.
After pushing to Github, use the pull request feature to merge into main.

## Merge conflicts
If Github shows that there is a merge conflict, use git merge. The easiest way to do this is to do git merge main and resolve the conflict in VS Code.
