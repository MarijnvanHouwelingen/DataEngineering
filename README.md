# Rules when working in my Repo :)

## Branching
Whenever you start working. Start a *Branch*. This is done by the command: _git checkout -b feature/branchname_.
Make sure to name the branch after the work you are doing, e.g feature/mlops. After you have finished work
on your task, use _git add . -> git commit -m "message"_ and _git push_ to push your changes to Github.
After pushing to Github, use the pull request feature to merge into main.

*Create a branch everytime you work start working on the project*.
*Merge the branch with main when you stop working for the day*

## Merge conflicts
If Github shows that there is a merge conflict, use _git merge_. The easiest way to do this is to do git merge main and resolve the conflict in VS Code. 

## Text editor
Use nano as your tekst editor in the bash command prompt instead of vi. Nano is more intuitive than vi.
